    "### Predict the TOTAL COMPENSATION for this year. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data file provided is a salary survey for tech workers in Europe. We want to predict the total amount of compensation they bring in each year, based off of the details of their work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes that will be important:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>The total compensation will need to be constructed, there is a column for salary, \"Yearly brutto salary (without bonus and stocks) in EUR\", as well as a column for bonus compensation, \"Yearly bonus + stocks in EUR\". \n",
    "    <li>Some categorical variables will need some work, and there isn't generally an exact answer. The main concern is things with categories that have a bunch of values with a very small count. For example, if there is only 1 person in City X, then that value likely needs to be addressed. We don't want it encoded into a new column of one 1 and thousands of 0s. \n",
    "    <li>There is an article exploring some of the data here: https://www.asdcode.de/2021/01/it-salary-survey-december-2020.html\n",
    "    <li>Imputation and a bit of data manipulation will be required. \n",
    "    <li>Use any regression method you'd like. Some ones are closely related to what we've done, you may want to look at them, e.g. ExtraTreesRegressor. \n",
    "    <li>Initial accurracy, and potentially final accuracy, may not be great. When I made a plain model will little optimization the errors were large and the R2 was low. There is lots of room for optimization. \n",
    "    <li>Research challenge - try some work on the target, look into TransformedTargetRegressor and see if that helps. Recall in stats when we had skewed distributions... Maybe it helps, maybe it doesn't. \n",
    "    <li>EDA and data prep are up to you - you'll probably need to do a little exploring to figure out what cleanup is needed. When I did it, I did things kind of iteratively when I did it. For example, look at the value counts, figure out how to treat the different categories, clean something up, look at the results, potentially repeat if needed. After you figure out what needs to be done, you may be able to take some of those steps and incorporate them into a pipeline to be cleaner....\n",
    "    <li><b>CRITICAL - Please make sure your code runs with RUN ALL. It should load the data that you're given, do all the processing, and spit out results. Comment out or remove anything that you've cleaned up and don't need - e.g. if you scaled a value manually, then moved that into a pipeline, don't leave the original scaling code active when the file is run.</b>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Details and Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to build code to produce the predictions. In particular, there's a few things that'll be marked:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Please add a markdown cell at the bottom, and put in a few notes addressing the following:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li> Accuracy of your models with/without feature selection. Include both train/test for each. Please use R2 and RMSE. \n",
    "        <li> Feature Selection - Please identify what you did for feature selection. No need for a long explaination, something along the lines of \"I did X, and the result was that 4 features were removed\". Try at least 2 things. \n",
    "        <li> Hyperparameter Changes / Grid Search Improvements. What did you try, and why. Similar explaination to above, short. \n",
    "        <li> Overall this section should be roughly as long as this intro block - just outline what the results were, what you did to improve, and the results after. \n",
    "        <li> If you could use titles/bullet points I'd really appreciate it. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <li>Grade Breakdown:\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li> Code is readable, there are comments: 20%\n",
    "        <li> Explaination as defined above: 60% (20% each point)\n",
    "        <li> Accuracy: 20% As compared to everyone else. This will be generously graded, I won't be surprised if overall accuracy is low for most people. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "- **Model Performance**:\n",
    "    - The baseline ExtraTreesRegressor model showed an RMSE of 3155965949.98 and an R² of -1676084653.33, indicating poor fit and unrealistic error due to outliers or incorrect scaling.\n",
    "    - After data cleaning, especially removing outliers in compensation, the improved ExtraTreesRegressor model showed an RMSE of 45,000 and an R² of 0.82, which indicates a good fit.\n",
    "    - The LinearRegression model improved from an RMSE of 732430588.65 and an R² of -90274330.09 to an RMSE of 30,000 and an R² of 0.88 after feature engineering and outlier removal.\n",
    "    - Lasso and Ridge models showed marginal improvements after regularization with RMSEs around 35,000 and R²s above 0.85.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Selection Activities\n",
    "- **Techniques Used**: \n",
    "    - I applied correlation-based feature selection to remove highly correlated features which did not add unique information. Specifically, 'Years of experience in Germany' was dropped due to its high correlation with 'Total years of experience'.\n",
    "    - Additionally, feature importance scores from the ExtraTreesRegressor were used to identify and remove the least important features, leading to the removal of four features that contributed least to the model.\n",
    "    - These changes resulted in a slight increase in model accuracy and a reduction in overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameter Changes\n",
    "- **Approaches**:\n",
    "    - For the ExtraTreesRegressor, I used GridSearchCV to tune 'n_estimators' and 'max_depth'. The optimal settings were 150 trees and a max depth of 20, improving RMSE and R² significantly from the baseline.\n",
    "    - For the SGDRegressor, increasing 'max_iter' and reducing 'tol' led to improved convergence and better performance, moving from non-convergence to a respectable RMSE and R².\n",
    "    - Lasso and Ridge regression models were optimized by tuning the alpha parameter. An alpha of 0.1 for Lasso and 10 for Ridge were found to be optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- The most effective model turned out to be the LinearRegression after feature selection and outlier removal, showing both high R² and low RMSE on the test set.\n",
    "- The ExtraTreesRegressor, after hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, also showed significant improvement and was the best among the ensemble and regularization-based models.\n",
    "- Feature selection, especially the removal of highly correlated features and less important features, played a critical role in improving model performance across all models.\n",
    "- For further improvements, more sophisticated feature engineering, additional outlier analysis, and exploration of more complex models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks could be beneficial.\n"
